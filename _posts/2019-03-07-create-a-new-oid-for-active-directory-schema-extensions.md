title: "Create a New OID for Active Directory Schema Extensions"
---

This article is for individuals who need an OID to create custom Active Directory schema classes or attributes, and do not already have a Private Enterprise Number (PEN) from http://pen.iana.org. This is specific to Active Directory. If you are using some other LDAP directory, refer to its documentation or register for a PEN.

There are a lot of scary warnings on the internet to get your OID right before customizing the Active Directory schema. I will start by showing you how to create a base OID you can use for all of your schema extensions. Then I will suggest a (possibly incorrect) way to extend your base OID for your custom schema objects.

## Create your base OID
Run this bit of PowerShell code to create a base OID beginning with the prefix from the reference VBScript.

```powershell
$Prefix = '1.2.840.113556.1.8000.2554'
$Guid = (New-Guid).guid.Replace('-','')
$SubstringArgs = (0,4),(4,4),(8,4),(12,4),(16,4),(20,6),(26,6)
$OidSuffixParts = foreach ($ArgPair in $SubstringArgs) {
    [Convert]::ToInt64($Guid.Substring($ArgPair[0],$ArgPair[1]),16)
}
$Suffix = $OidSuffixParts -join '.'
$Prefix, $Suffix) -join '.'
```

I ended up with this OID: `1.2.840.113556.1.8000.2554.29303.55750.9464.19531.42101.14752338.11883148`

## Create and follow an OID usage policy
I don't know if this is the right way to use OIDs in AD, but this is the way I do it.

### Assign a number to any class you plan to modify

| Class | OID Number |
|-------|------------|
| User | 1 |
| Group | 2 |
| Computer | 3 |
| Contact | 4 |
| Organization-Unit | 5 |

Create and maintain a similar table for each of your custom schema attributes. Example:

| Atrribute | OID Number |
|-------|------------|
| Rob-Custom-Attrib1 | 1 |
| Rob-Favorite-Color | 2 |

### Append these numbers to your base OID when creating a new schema attribute

Every time you create a schema attribute, append a period and the class's number to the end of your base OID as a new base for the class. Using the OID I created above, my Group class's base OID would be `1.2.840.113556.1.8000.2554.29303.55750.9464.19531.42101.14752338.11883148.3`.

Then append a period and your attribute's OID number to the end of that to get your attribute's OID. My Rob-Favorite-Color OID would be `1.2.840.113556.1.8000.2554.29303.55750.9464.19531.42101.14752338.11883148.3.2`.

That's it! Now you have a base OID you can build on when customizing Active Directory. This scheme should not interfere with AD, and no other schema extensions should interfere with it.

I developed this solution after reading the following article, and examining the related VBScript. I'm sorry if they no longer exist...
